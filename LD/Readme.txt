| How to play |
+-------------+
Use WASD to move and space to attack an enemy or interact with a sign or chest

You will get one hint in every level which of the three chests in the world is
the right one.
If you open the right one everything is good.
If you open one of the wrong chests the next level will be harder.

The game is over if you get killed by an enemy.

Have fun :)

| How to build the game |
+-----------------------+
You'll need Visual Studio (I guess everything from 2010 upwards should be ok)
and the SharpDX Toolkit (I used the latest available dev version)

You need to have an Environment Variable called SharpDXSdkDir defined which should point
to the path where your Toolkit is enabled

If you have everything you can build the game from Visual Studio
